### Introduction
This project is about a website for people to be aware of the incoming event which will be coming up in this winter. The name of the festival is called "Snow Sculpture Winter Festival" (SSWF).

Each page of the website contains some information about the website. The first page which is the home page consists of some history about the festival with 7 different types of pictures that says more about the event. Also, all the 3 pages contains time count down, it contains Day, hours, minutes and seconds that the event is going to last for.

The Second page consists of information about when the event is going to take place. The has 3 different types of images at the bottom end of the timer, each picture was embedded with some contents which contains time, date and type of events that's coming up. There's also a snow picture which serve as moving content of the webpage, this content can lead to another external link.

The 3rd pages contain information about the people that want to come for the event (festival). The page contains a button which allow each visitor or people that want to buy ticket of the event to put information about themselves in order to be identify.

The website page was build according to what we've been thought in the class. This not a real website, it was only build for the school project (All the content was only made up by the group members). Those pictures were downloaded from pixel image website.

Thank you.
